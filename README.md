Webpage connecting to an API

In this assignment I created a webpage loaded with AJAX data returned from an API.

This is to test my knowledge of JSON objects, AJAX, working with APIs and html/css/js. Vanilla JS, jQuery or both can be used to complete the assignment.

The choice of API was up to me . I could use XHR or fetch to access the data.

The page needed to have at least one event that triggers the initial API call. This could be a 'start' button, or a 'search' field with submit or something similar. On firing the event an AJAX request is made to an API and data is returned. The data must be a JSON object and not a simple string.

The data that is returned from the call must be dynamically displayed on the page. I could populate pre-existing elements or dynamically create elements.

The specifications will depend somewhat on my choice of API.
